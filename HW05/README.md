# Problem Solving

Assume you open your ice cream shop, there are only two types of ice cream, vanilla and strawberry. When a box of ice cream is sold, you will get the benefit for $ 2 for vanilla ice cream and $ 3 for strawberry ice cream. To make the ice cream, the fresh milk is required. To make a box of vanilla ice cream requires 0.5 liter and strawberry ice cream requires 0.2 liter. You daily order 10 liters of fresh milk. To promote your ice cream shop, you give a doll for each ice cream box. The number of dolls, that you can give to customers, is 30 dolls per day. So, how many boxes of vanilla ice cream and strawberry ice cream that you would like to produce to get maximum profit ?

| Favor      | Profit $/(Box) | Fresh milk/(Liter) |
| ---        | ---            | ---                |
| Vanilla    | 2              | 0.5                |
| Strawberry | 3              | 0.2                |

**Constrain**
- Order daily 10 liters of fresh milk
- Dolls for each ice cream box. (30 per day)
